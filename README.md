# Silent Crashes in Express.js

This repository demonstrates a scenario where an Express.js application might crash silently without providing helpful error messages.  The issue stems from unexpected situations during request handling where error handling is insufficient.

## Bug Description

The primary problem is that the application might terminate unexpectedly without any clear indication of what went wrong.  Standard error logging might not capture the root cause, leading to difficulty in debugging.

## Solution

The solution involves comprehensive error handling.  Instead of relying solely on implicit error handling, we explicitly handle potential exceptions and log errors with sufficient detail.  This makes debugging significantly easier and more efficient.
